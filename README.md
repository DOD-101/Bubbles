# Bubbles

What is "Bubbles" ? ðŸ›€

Bubbles is a collection of different code snippets, which allow anyone to quickly insert and
modify a bubble effect around the cursor on their website.

## Usage
To use any of these bubble Effects on your website simply link the js file to your HTML and copy the
css into your Stylesheet.

While credit is greatly appreciated it is by no means required.

## Different Versions

- v1: Most Basic Version; not recommended for use

- v2: Iteration on v1; good for use if movement of Bubbles isn't wanted

- v3: Most recent Version; recommended for general use

- v3_gs; Still somewhat WIP; adds a gradient to the bubbles and makes them first turn white then
disappear

- round cursor; Simply a round cursor, not directly related to the other snippets

- canvas-round cursor; Highly discouraged from use, simply here as an idea for others to work off of

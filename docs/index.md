## Bubbles v1

This was the very first Bubbles code snippet, it includes:

    - Bubbles spawning in the path of the cursor
    - Bubbles in all different colors

    - Ease of editing not a priory

USAGE: Not recommended for most use cases.

## Bubbles v2

Second iteration; it includes:

    Same as v1:
        - Bubbles spawning in the path of the cursor
        - Bubbles in all different colors

    Added:
        - Bubbles fade out
        - Bubbles expand

    - Ease of editing not a priory

USAGE: Recommended only if you do not want bubbles to move.

## Bubbles v3

Third iteration, and currently the newest; it includes:

    Same as v2:
        - Bubbles spawning in the path of the cursor
        - Bubbles in all different colors
        - Bubbles fade out
        - Bubbles expand

    Added:
        - Bubbles move based on the speed of the mouse at the time of spawning

    - Ease of editing slightly improved

USAGE: Recommended general usage

## Bubbles v3 gs

gs stands for: gradient + suds (the white effect)

Based on v3, but:

    - Bubbles first turn white (color can be changed)
    - Bubbles have a gradient

USAGE: If you prefer the look of this over v3.

## Round cursor / canvas-round cursor

These were the first steps in the development mainly here for ideas
for other people.

<u> Note on canvas-round cursor: </u> This is not recommended to be used
in pretty any case as it has bugs and is simply a worse solution than
using the non canvas option.

## Future Plans

This is not a project I will be actively updating, only if someone finds a
serious bug or I just feel like working on it.
